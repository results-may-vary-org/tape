## Description

Blur the wallpaper if a windows is active.

### main feature

- live thumbnail preview
- keep all the behavior of the default `image` plugin made by kde like :
    - auto apply the wallpaper on click
    - add color and blur option in function of the positioning
- give you the ability to deactivate the effect
- give you the ability to change the blur radius and the animation delay
- the slideshow wallpaper type is available too
- `new` now you can also darken the wallpaper and choose the color and the transparency of this effect

### history

My own code for replacing [inactiveblur](https://github.com/Zren/plasma-wallpapers/tree/master/inactiveblur) that it seems to be abandoned.

I have duplicated the default KDE `image` plugin so all the default effect and behavior is still present.
