## Why do you have made another note-taking app?

Just like my [postier](https://github.com/bouteillerAlan/postier) project (that I have to finish)
, I'm just tired of 'free' software that embark a shitload of feature, mandatory user account and creepy privacy statement.

Plus I have searched for an OSS note-taking app that is simple and not based on a "journaling" system. I just want to take notes. I just want the UI to be nice.

So I started this project. I know that developing this kind of stuff implies a lot of stuff (or maybe not if I want to keep it simple) but this is a cool adventure so - let's go :)

You can embark with me by contributing or via a [tips](https://github.com/sponsors/bouteillerAlan).
