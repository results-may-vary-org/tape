# Tape MCP Server

This document explains what the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server does and how to use it with your Tape markdown editor.

## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a protocol that enables AI assistants to securely access external data sources and tools. The Tape MCP server allows AI assistants to interact with your markdown notes directly.

## What does the Tape MCP Server do?

The Tape MCP server provides AI assistants with the ability to:

### üìÅ File Operations
- **Read files**: Access content from your markdown files
- **Write files**: Create or modify markdown files
- **Create files**: Generate new markdown documents
- **Delete files**: Remove unwanted files
- **List files**: Browse your markdown file structure

### üóÇÔ∏è Folder Operations
- **Create folders**: Organize your notes with new directories
- **List directories**: Navigate your folder structure
- **Get file tree**: Access the complete workspace hierarchy

### üîç Search Capabilities
- **Content search**: Find specific text across all your markdown files
- **Case-sensitive search**: Option for precise text matching
- **Context retrieval**: Get surrounding text for better understanding

### üîó Workspace Integration
- **Root directory access**: Work within your current Tape workspace
- **Relative path support**: Use paths relative to your workspace
- **Configuration integration**: Uses your current Tape folder settings

## How to Use

### 1. Start the MCP Server
In the Tape application:
- Look for the **MCP** button in the header (next to theme selection)
- Click the button to start/stop the server
- When running, you'll see a green "Running" badge
- When stopped, you'll see a gray "Stopped" badge

### 2. Connect Your AI Assistant
Configure your AI assistant to use the Tape MCP server:

**Example with claude desktop:**
Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tape": {
      "command": "/path/to/tape-mcp",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Interact Through AI
Once connected, you can ask your AI assistant to:

**Examples:**
- "Read my project notes and summarize them"
- "Create a new file called 'meeting-notes.md' with today's agenda"
- "Search for all mentions of 'deadline' in my files"
- "Organize my notes by creating a folder structure"
- "List all my markdown files in the projects folder"

- ‚ùå Sampling (not implemented)
- ‚ùå Logging (not implemented)

### Prompts Available
The server includes helpful prompts for:
1. **organize_notes**: Help organize and structure markdown notes
2. **create_outline**: Create structured outlines for new documents
3. **summarize_notes**: Create summaries of existing notes

## Security & Privacy

### What the MCP Server Can Access
- ‚úÖ Your current Tape workspace folder and all its contents
- ‚úÖ Only markdown (.md) files for most operations
- ‚úÖ Folder structure within your workspace

### What the MCP Server Cannot Access
- ‚ùå Files outside your workspace directory
- ‚ùå System files or directories
- ‚ùå Hidden files (starting with .)
- ‚ùå Non-markdown files (except for folder operations)

### Data Privacy
- All Tape communication happens locally
- Tape do not send data to external servers
- By default your files remain on your computer

## Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start
- Check that you have a workspace folder open in Tape
- Ensure the `tape-mcp` binary exists in your Tape installation directory
- Look at the MCP status button for error information

### AI Assistant Can't Connect
- Verify the MCP server is running (green "Running" status)
- Check your AI assistant's MCP configuration
- Ensure the path to `tape-mcp` is correct in your configuration

### Commands Not Working
- Make sure you have a workspace folder selected in Tape
- Verify file paths are relative to your workspace
- Check that target directories exist for file operations

### Performance Issues
- The server indexes files on demand, so large workspaces might be slower
- Search operations scan all markdown files, which may take time with many files
- Consider organizing files into subfolders for better performance

## Best Practices

### File Organization
- Use descriptive file names for better AI understanding
- Organize related notes in folders
- Keep a consistent naming convention

### Working with AI
- Be specific about file paths when requesting operations
- Use descriptive content when creating new files
- Take advantage of search to help AI find relevant context

### Workspace Management
- Keep your workspace focused on related documents
- Regularly organize files using the AI assistant's help
- Use the file tree resource to help AI understand your structure
